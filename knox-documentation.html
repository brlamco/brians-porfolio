                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">What is Knox Docs:</div>
                  Knox Docs is the design system documentation hub used internally by developers and designers at 1Password. It is the single source of truth (SSOT) that was established within the organization to empower the product team to do their best work easily and quickly find information on how to design and implement high quality experiences that are consistent, scalable, and accessible for everyone.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Context:</div>
                  Existing search functionalities focuses on separating search results into different sections or search panes. While it does well at organizing queried results categorically, we’ve found that enclosing information in separate views increased the risk of users not finding content of relevance and even worse ending up with empty or no results.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Involvement:</div>
                  As a product designer, I led the end-to-end design of Knox Docs and collaborated with the User Experience Research (UXR) team to understand how to enhance the user experience of the website to increase engagement amongst our product partners.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Goals:</div>
                  The search improvements initiative leverages user-informed data gathered through user research to redesign a more inviting and efficient way to search and find design system content. By improving search, we want to enable all users–more specifically people working in product to find the information they are looking for or that they may not have come across before or even was not aware the information existed through searching.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Results:</div>
                  With the team's efforts, the redesigned search experience was successfully launched in November 2022. We observed positive impacts in the adoption of the design system with a growing amount of search completion.<br /><br />

                  Irrelevant search results and cluttered design system content affects how designers and engineers feel, and plays a major part in how they perceive the design system. The final iteration also saw improvements in reducing the time it takes for users to find information.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  I work with a UX researcher to better understand how people use search to find documentation. We reviewed UX analysis which documented research insights from past user interviews and ran a qualitative interview of our own to further surface patterns and pain points.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Problem 01</div>
                  Most participant’s usual route to information begins with navigating in the directory of the site navigation sidebar.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Problem 02</div>
                  Very few participants would use the search bar to initiate search. While those who use the search bar found that it was easily findable, the results consists of messy information that had very little relevancy in what they were searching for.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Problem 03</div>
                  When a desired content was not found (or does not display any suggestive results), participants would generally abandon their search and set to look for information elsewhere.<br /><br />

                  After digging into the archives of all the user feedback from the past, we wanted to make sure that reports coming from the UX repository are still existing user problems and are accurate to date. We ran a qualitative research session with Knox users to validate our assumptions of the existing records.<br /><br /> 

                  At the end of the research, we collaboratively sorted data that came up the most and distilled them into insights.<br /><br />

                  We identified patterns in our debriefing session and have a good grasped of what problems and opportunities we are going to solve. In order to inform our design strategy and vision to improve the search experience, I created user stories to help articulate the research data into user needs to help us understand why users want a specific search functionality.<br /><br />

                  The driving force for the search experience is to increase discoverability and make discovering relevance easier. An inviting search experience is integral in order for designers and engineers to to easily scan search results and find content that’s meaningful to their work.<br /><br />

                  Our overarching design objective was to ensure that our target users can successfully use search in the platform and can see value in it.<br /><br />

                  Using the findings that we learned from internal stakeholders in the user interviews, I determined design requirements and pinpoint where we should begin work. It was essential to refer back to the data learned in the user research, and to use these requirements as our guiding principles as we moved into the design improvement phase.<br /><br /> 

                  We wanted to ship an MVP as quickly as possible. I work closely with the team product manager and developer to brainstorm what the focus areas for the search improvements would be and determine which UX enhancements were essential to assist searchers in finding information quickly.<br /><br />

                  To address the user needs written in the perspective of the user story for a product designer, I added a visual thumbnail for each search result to help users easily sift through and find information efficiently.<br /><br />

                  This implementation turn out to have alleviated all the headache that users were experiencing with viewing search results. Visual thumbnails assisted users in searching for information quickly because they can locate the semantic token name and determine stylistic its appearance upfront with a preview next to the token name.<br /><br />

                  Search recommendations was introduced to address the needs presented in all the user stories. In our research studies, we learn that it can be challenging for users to find information that best suit their needs.<br /><br />

                  The purpose of having personalized content suggestions in the initial view of the search UI is to provide users with ‘tailored’ recommendations while also accompanying them to find documentation that genuinely adds value to their search experience.<br /><br />

                  Adding search recommendations proved to be useful to the research participants we showed these designs to. The team is continuously reviewing search patterns to understand their specific needs and preferences so that we can continuously keep recommendations fresh and help us refine its future suggestions.<br /><br />

                  Using tabbed segmentation in the context of filtering not only increased negatively on cognitive load, but also confused users. While a segmented control can help users switch between views as they are searching, the search experience however becomes disconnected because the user has to click back and forth to compare results.<br /><br />

                  Recognizing the need to simplify searching along with the filtering system, I explored several options and a multitude of directions to have a better understanding of what might resonate with our users. When it comes to filtering, users expects that it should be simple and can help them view an assortment of their search results more efficiently. In our user testing sessions, 5/5 users perceived that the multi-select filter containing checkboxes of the property’s they could choose to filter by was easier to use than the tabs from the initial design. The majority of participants did not use tabs as it was not clear that they could filter with it.<br /><br />

                  Presently, when a user searches for a term that did not produce any results—they are returned with ‘no results found’. Filtering using the navigation tab also sometimes does not produce any results either.<br /><br />

                  While users had expressed that this is not necessarily a serious issue to them since they can rephrase their words or use descriptive text when searching. The message in the empty state gave them the impression that we don’t offer information that the user is looking for. Normally when there are no results, users still expects to see a selection of other or similar meaningful content to get them back on track with searching for documentation.<br /><br />

                  Working in partnership with the content team, we proposed to help orient users by revising the messaging to clearly explain the situation and identify how we can reduce the anxiety that comes with searching to turn a situation into something that is engaging and helpful for users. I use the available space in the UI to add suggestive pathways that users can easily find information they are looking for and to help them successfully complete the search process.<br /><br />

                  After running another round of usability testing the design with users, we were excited to move forward with the new solution.<br /><br /> 
                  
                  The iteration of the search experience drew positive sentiments from both designers and engineers. While we were testing the discoverability of newly designed experience, we saw a reduction in search dropoff as well as faster issue resolution. This lead to a decrease in the time it took for users to determine what information was useful to them.<br /><br />

                  Achieving a balance between effective design and business constraints is a constant challenge. The search experience has room for improvements, but we cannot do it all given the resources and time that we have. In future iterations, we need to identify what design changes will have the most positive impact to maximize user satisfaction on the experience and prioritize those.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Balancing between user needs and perfection</div>
                  Being a self-critical product designer, I tend to aim for perfection or at least close to it. Knox Docs is a work in progress that must evolve and scale as the business and product grows. While perfection is important in some situations, if we always seek for perfection, the search feature can never be launched.<br /><br />

                  There are still many challenges that we are solving for in this space. We believe there is also a lot of potential to improve searching as we learn more about the users search intent. In the future iteration of this feature, we are working on refining the search experience by using information we learned from users to expand our queries.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Be comfortable with not knowing everything</div>
                  There’s always someone visiting Knox Docs to find information that we haven’t thought of that users had considered to be useful to them. We have only started uncovering some of the basic problems that users face with search and there is more undiscovered opportunities and potential to continuously improve the search experience. But that’s the case with any product.<br /><br />
