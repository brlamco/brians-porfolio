                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">What is import passwords?:</div>
                  Importing passwords is a new feature that enables users to seamlessly migrate credentials from their existing password manager or browser into 1Password.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Context:</div>
                  Admins from within their organizations as well as new customers have limited capabilities when it comes to importing data from their existing password manager using the 1Password web app. Data migration is a core value proposition for 1Password, the web app is lacking key migration tools that would allow users to have a seamless transition and to begin moving all of their data into 1Password.<br /><br />
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

                <p>
                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Involvement:</div>
                  As the lead product designer, I was responsible for spearheading critical aspects of the password migration flow, from researching and planning to brainstorming and designing the MVP product, Alpha, Beta, and General Availability (GA) stages. Throughout the development process, I consistently worked to enhance the import functionality in the admin console application and user experience, ensuring that users can successfully migrate their credentials.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Goals:</div>
                  Improve users completion rate of importing by providing teams and enterprises with a clear starting point that focused on creating the most impactful method of migration that they can use to migrate passwords. Since customers from enterprise company and small businesses have specific requirements and needs, we want to focus on helping users achieve a seamless password migration experience of moving their data from an existing service into 1Password.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Results:</div>
                  As a result of making the design changes, we were able to launch the importer to the general public and saw an increase the import completion rate. We were also able to get people to migrate into 1Password faster and saw that a majority of user were able to successfully complete the entire segment of the import process upon updating each step with more educational support to fill their knowledge gaps.<br /><br />

                <p>
                  Before jumping into the design solution, I wanted to connect the customer problems with the business goals. I wanted to discover users current processes/decision-making about importing passwords and how they feel about the overall experience. I work closely with a UX Researcher to gather insights on the current user pain points, frustrations, and barriers related to importing into the 1Password web app.<br /><br /> 

                  With the support of research, we received over 40+ user feedbacks which provided understanding into what important user needs and wants the importer was not fulfilling and align requirements on what we can implement to win back churned-customers. We have categorized the problems and identified some major pain points:<br /><br /> 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Insight 01</div>
                  Users were churning from the web app because we were lacking in our communication to them at crucial points in the importing process.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Insight 02</div>
                  Users who were unfamiliar with the concept of importing struggled to figure out how to do basic tasks, such as exporting data from their current service or following a CSV template to prepare their file for import.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Insight 03</div>
                  Users felt blindsided by certain security rules and regulations that they felt werenâ€™t expressed to them at the point of import.<br /><br />

                  To manage user expectations, we needed to design a solution that will give users the flexibility they need to accomplish importing passwords without blocking them, but also educate them on the import requirements to preserve data quality when importing.<br /><br />

                  While this approach has more steps than the current flow, the new design clearly showed value in importing passwords. Each step contains instructions, so that users understand how importing works and what they need to move their credentials to 1Password. I also collaborated with a UX writer to update the language in all the importing steps to be more clear to users since the current version contains technical terminologies that made users feel less confident in completing import.<br /><br />

                  We ran an unmoderated usability test with 10 participants. The participants we selected were currently using a password manager that isnâ€™t 1Password. All participants were asked to start the importing process from an existing provider of their choice.<br /><br />

                  All users were able to find guidance for how to import their data, regardless of which service they had choose to export from and import into 1Password. However, users were most confused by the isolation of the â€˜export dataâ€™ step and the â€˜upload fileâ€™ step. Nearly all users had concerns about their progression in the import process and wanted a clearer sense of where they are or at least (measure how close they are to completion). <br /><br />

Certain parts of the importing process was far from perfect and we want users to recognize the value of our service and address issues that is driving customer churn.<br /><br />

                  The design modifications consists of resolving issues discovered during the unmoderated usability test with users and the remaining key themes that we had wanted to focus on in our roadmap.<br /><br />

                  Users were unconfident when they are deep in the importing process and are unable to determine how many steps are left until they successfully complete it. For some users, the path through the import process may be quick and simple, while for others it can be duplicative and requires a lot of mapping.<br /><br />

                  A progress indicator was implemented into the import process to help users keep track of their progress during each phase of data migration. We were able to see that users were more confident in their next steps when we use indicators because expectations were managed upfront and user have an increase in understand of  how much time and effort the import process will take.<br /><br />

                  In previous versions of the import process, users were unaware that they had to examine each column and its contentâ€”and then label them to make the import file compatible for import. Some users had assumed that the CSV file that theyâ€™ve uploaded will be mapped automatically based on their defined item type.<br /><br />

                  The importer requires the CSV file header row to determine how to map data. To help users acknowledge that these columns are requirements and need labeling for accurate data import, the corresponding column headers are highlighted in a red accent to indicate unmapped columns and to prompt users to map them if it was ignored or skipped. When columns are completely labelled, the headers are highlighted in a green accent reassuring the user that they can move forward to complete import.<br /><br />

                  Showing the exporting instructions separate from the â€˜upload fileâ€™ step felt peculiarly disjointed to users. In the previous version, users would have to know exactly how to export their saved password from their providers. They didnâ€™t particularly like having to navigate back to preview the instructions.<br /><br />

                  I combined the on-screen instructions to the â€˜upload fileâ€™ step of the importing process to make it easier and faster for users to export their data. We saw slight increases in upload completion, and in the number of users that were able to complete this step and successfully importing their data over to our service.<br /><br />

                  On experimenting with the new label, we changed the â€˜titleâ€™ label to â€˜item nameâ€™ because it was well perceived by most users. Users intuitively knew while mapping that if a column contains website names, they would assign the "item name" label.<br /><br />

                  Minimize the use of technical terminology that customers who are less familiar with importing passwords or encryption might not understand. For example, limit the use of terms such as â€˜no unencrypted data ever leaves your deviceâ€™ or â€˜make sure you delete the unencrypted CSV file.â€™<br /><br />

                  It was important to communicate our brands dedication to protecting customer data. The updated messaging is more direct and clear about actions and certain risks of not â€˜deleting an encryptedâ€™. Users understood the risks of exporting a file containing their passwords that we recommend that they take these actions to keep their data out of the hands of bad actors.<br /><br />

                  A guided tour was implemented into the import flow to assist users in troubleshooting some common problems that can occur and how to format the CSV file. It was added to provide more support and to help fill knowledge gaps so that they could move forward in the flow.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Handling different item categories</div>
                  The importer can only import passwords and items from specific password managers or browsers. With this technical limitation, it was mandatory for users moving data to 1Password to create a CSV file containing only one item category and manually perform theÂ import one at a time.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Additional guidance during data mapping</div>
                  There are still untapped opportunities to improve the importer to support importing a CSV file with custom field labels and improve the speed it takes to import.<br /><br />

                  <div class="case-study-subtitle">Import does not recognize duplicate items</div>
                  The importer does not check whether items in the CSV file to import already exist in your vault. If the user happens to import multiple files or import a file with items that already exists in their vault,Â it will create duplicates of that item. Users would have to go into the vault where the duplicate item was imported into to remove any entries they might not need.<br /><br />

                  Item deduplication was a feature that many users had requested to see implemented into the importer. This was not easily solvable because it is difficult to determine whether if anÂ item is an accidentalÂ duplicate in the file that needs to be deleted, or if it is an intentionalÂ duplicate that needs to be preserved to import.<br /><br />
